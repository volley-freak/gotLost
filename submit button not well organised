<Left       Right>

<Previous   Next>

<Back       Forward>

<Back       Done

Go back     Continue

Do nothing  Do it

Cancel      OK

Except OK should be replaced with the actual action such as Save Delete Accept Exit or Send.

When I meet people arguing for putting OK on the left, I always ask them to place Left vs Right, 
Previous vs Next, and Back vs Forward, and let them argue why they put them in that order,
before letting them argue why OK should be on the left.
